# Projects
 I completed a project involving the algorithmic design of the closest pair of points, This project likely focused on algorithms that efficiently find the two points with the smallest distance between them in a set of points. One common approach is the Divide and Conquer algorithm, which can achieve a time complexity of O(nlogn)
